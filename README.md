## Introduction

This mod is allows Bards and Bard Kits (including those from mods) to use Pick Locks, Find/Disarm Traps, and Pick Pockets. On level up until level 20, the Bard will receive 5 skills points each in Pick Locks, Find/Disarm Traps, and Pick Pockets. The Action Bar is updated via EEex to allow Bards to Sing, Detect Traps, and Use Thieving Abilities at the loss of the quickspell.

## Compatibility
This mod requires the EEex created by Bubbs to work. Additionally, please install this after any other mods that add Bard kits or alter bard spells/abilities. Being this requires EEex to run, Windows is required at this time.

## Special Thanks

- Bubbs for all of his work on EEex as well as providing the .lua file required to alter the actionbar.
